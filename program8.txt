\section{Introduction to Theorems}
Mathematical documents include elements that require special formatting and numbering

\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
Let \(f\) be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then \(f\) is a continuous function.
\label{pythagorean}
This is a theorem about right triangles and can be summarised in the next equation 
\[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]


\begin{corollary}
There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm.
\end{corollary}

\section{Introduction to Definition}
The package amsthm provide special commands to accomplish this.
\begin{definition}[Fibration]
A fibration is a mapping between two topological spaces that has the homotopy lifting property for every space \(X\).
\end{definition}


\section{Introduction to Lemma \&\ Proof}
defines a new theorem-like environment called "lemma"
\begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively there is a 
real number \(r\) such that \(b=ra\).
\end{lemma}

\end{theorem}
